/**The default strategy for keeping track of prototype providers and working with provisioned prototypes, merging them into the current menu and/or a toolbar of a frame.
When the prototype providers change provided prototypes, those provided prototypes are processed.
This version monitors the parent composite component children and automatically uses top-level prototype providers added to or removed from the hierarchy.
Prototype provisions are not processed initially; this strategy should be initialized after construction by calling {@link #processPrototypeProvisions()}.
This class is thread safe based upon its exposed read and write locks.
